## 🎯 Key Benefits

### 1. Clear Organization by Business Domain
Each button/service has its own folder:
- **Home** → Landing page
- **Account Opening** → KYC/KYB flows
- **Company Formation** → Entity creation
- **Dashboard** → User dashboard
- **Accounting** → Invoicing (Phase 2)
- **Tax Advisory** → Tax consultations (Phase 2)
- **Life Insurance** → Insurance products (Phase 2)
- **Investment Advisory** → Investment services (Phase 2)
- **Mortgage** → Mortgage applications (Phase 2)

### 2. Easy to Find Everything
```
Need to work on invoicing? → features/accounting/
Need to update dashboard?  → features/dashboard/
Need shared button?        → shared/components/ui/button.tsx
```

### 3. Self-Documenting
Every feature has a README explaining:
- What it does
- What components it contains
- What routes it uses
- Implementation status

### 4. Scalable
As you add new features:
1. Create folder in `features/`
2. Add README
3. Build components
4. Add route in `app/`

### 5. Better Collaboration
Team members can work on different features independently without conflicts.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Working on an Existing Feature

1. **Navigate to feature:**
   ```bash
   cd features/dashboard
   ```

2. **Read the README:**
   ```bash
   cat README.md
   ```

3. **Find components:**
   ```bash
   ls components/
   ```

4. **Edit component:**
   ```bash
   # Edit timeline.tsx or status-chip.tsx
   ```

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Create folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir features/new-feature
   ```

2. **Add README:**
   ```bash
   touch features/new-feature/README.md
   # Document: purpose, components, routes
   ```

3. **Create structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir features/new-feature/components
   touch features/new-feature/types.ts
   ```

4. **Add route:**
   ```bash
   mkdir app/[locale]/new-feature
   touch app/[locale]/new-feature/page.tsx
   ```

5. **Build components:**
   ```tsx
   // Use shared components
   import { Button } from "@/shared/components/ui/button"
   ```

### Adding a Shared Component

1. **Create component:**
   ```bash
   touch shared/components/MyComponent.tsx
   ```

2. **Document in shared/README.md**

3. **Use across features:**
   ```tsx
   import { MyComponent } from "@/shared/components/MyComponent"
   ```

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- Read feature README before working on it
- Keep features self-contained
- Use shared components for common UI
- Document new features with README
- Use path aliases for imports
- Add translations for all text

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't create tight coupling between features
- Don't duplicate shared components
- Don't skip documentation
- Don't use relative imports across features
- Don't hardcode strings (use i18n)

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Keeping Structure Organized

1. **When adding code:**
   - Ask: "Is this feature-specific or shared?"
   - Feature-specific → `features/[feature]/`
   - Shared → `shared/`

2. **When creating components:**
   - Used in 1 feature → `features/[feature]/components/`
   - Used in 2+ features → `shared/components/`

3. **When adding utilities:**
   - Feature-specific → `features/[feature]/utils.ts`
   - Shared → `shared/lib/`

4. **Update documentation:**
   - Feature README when adding components
   - Main README when adding features
